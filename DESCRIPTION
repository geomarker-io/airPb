Description: Easily and reproducibly assess exposure to airborne lead
    at specific locations in and around Cincinnati, Ohio. The package calculates predictions of air lead 
    exposure from a land use random forest model developed by Dr. Cole Brokamp based on ambient air sampling 
    in Cincinnati, OH between 2001 and 2005. Additionally scale estimates to account for temporal variation
    in air lead in the region.
